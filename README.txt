Simple program to experiment with Apple's Metal compute and draw shaders. With the compute shader creating a buffer that is then used by the draw shader

The program's compute buffer creates a profile for wave traveling in water using algorithms described in http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch01.html. Next a draw buffer shows a graph for the wave profile.
